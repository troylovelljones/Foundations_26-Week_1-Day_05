// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps 
    of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values 
    of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const PLANNING = `This is the first step, 
    in which the end goal of the software is determined 
    and defined. Developers typically will see what systems 
    are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.`;

const ANALYSIS = `The client has a vague idea of what is required. 
    The sales department, software engineers and domain experts 
    all collaborate to gather information about what the product should be, 
    its purposes and how it is supposed to work. 
    This analysis is often coupled by market surveys.`   

const DESIGN = `During this phase, the overall system architecture is designed
    by defining the functionality of each module as well as their interaction with
    third-party modules.`

const IMPLEMENTATION = `The product is built and coded according to the companyâ€™s own
     standards. Designers follow a set of best practices and guidelines, 
     and use the programming tools they have at their disposal to develop the product.` 
     
const TESTING_INTEGRATION = `The code is tested to make sure it is free of bugs, 
    adheres to the client requirements and correctly interfaces other software 
    products together with the underlying hardware.`   
    
const MAINTENANCE = `Maintenance is performed over time to change the system 
    architecture according to future needs.  Customer reported defects are addressed. 
    This may require the addition of code or alteration of the existing code`
